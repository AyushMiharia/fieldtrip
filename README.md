## Project Objective

FieldTrip is a peer-driven micro-adventure platform where college students post activities they've discovered, schedule group trips, manage RSVPs, and leave honest reviews — because group plans only work when people actually show up.

The project has a clean separation of concerns — **Ayush owns the activities management features** and **Siddharth owns the trip sessions & community features**, with both sharing a common authentication system, user profiles, and admin panel.

- `components/ayush/ActivityForm/` — Create and edit activity forms with validation
- `components/ayush/ActivityDetail/` — Full activity view with trip scheduling and management
- `components/ayush/SearchBar/` — Search input with filter dropdowns (category, difficulty, format, cost)

**User Stories Covered:**

- Browse all activities with search and filter by category, difficulty, cost range, format, and keyword
- Create, view, edit, and delete activities with title, category, difficulty, cost, group size, location, format, and description

### Siddharth — Trip Sessions & Community

**Backend:**

- `routes/siddharth/trips.js` — Full CRUD for trips, join/leave, complete/cancel, review system, stats aggregation, future date validation, participant filter

**Frontend:**

- `components/siddharth/ReviewForm/` — Star rating (1–5) with interactive hover + written feedback form

**User Stories Covered:**

- Schedule trips for any activity with a specific future date, time, and meeting point
- Join or leave trips — auto-updates status to "full" when capacity is reached, reopens when someone leaves
- Mark trips as completed (organizer only) — unlocks the review system
- Cancel trips (organizer only) — status changes to cancelled
- Leave star ratings and written reviews on completed trips (participants only, one review per person)
- "My Trips" page shows all trips organized or joined, split by status, with edit capability for upcoming organized trips
- Future date validation on both create and edit — past dates are rejected on both client and server side

## Instructions to Build & Run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or higher
- MongoDB Atlas account (free tier works)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AyushMiharia/fieldtrip.git
cd fieldtrip

# 2. Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# 3. Create your .env file (copy the example and fill in your values)
cp .env.example .env
```

Your `.env` file should look like:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@cluster.mongodb.net/fieldtrip?retryWrites=true&w=majority
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development
```

```bash
# 4. Seed the database (creates 1,000 activities, 500 trips, 52 users)
npm run seed

# 5. Start the backend server
npm start
```

```bash
# 6. In a new terminal — install and start the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

### Demo Accounts

| Role | Username | Password |
